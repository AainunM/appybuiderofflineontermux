## Personal Version
This is the personal version that can be run on Windows, Linux, or Mac for personal purpose.
Please note that since all Personal Servers use local version of Google App Engine (GAE), they are NOT stable and at unpredictable times, you may loose all your projects / data. As result, consider using the online version at http://Gold.AppyBuilder.com and use the Personal Version only for learning NOT production.

## Usage:
Make sure that Java is installed on your computer

AppyBuilder includes a front-end and a buildserver for building .apk

## Starting frontend:
Use File Explorer to switch to the new folder (AppyBuilderPersonl)
Next, double click onWinStartAppyBuilderServer.bat to start the frontend (or equivelant .sh file)
  IF the popup window immediately closes, this means that your java path is not setup properly.
    You may have to update the file to directly point to your java.exe; e.g.
    C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_121\bin\java.exe
    
   At this time, you can start a browser, and enter http://localhost:8888 

## Starting frontend:
If you are attempting to build .apk, you'll need to start the local buildserver
Use File Explorer to switch to the new folder (AppyBuilderPersonl)
Next, double click on WinStartAppyBuilderServer.cmd to start the buildserver (or equivelant .sh file)
IF your computer can't associate the .cmd, just rename it to .bat
